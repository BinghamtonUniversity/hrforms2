bug/fix:
 * add "id" key for all tables data

todo: 
 * Header styling needed
 * Email notification for requests
 * User should not be able to approve/reject requests they submitted.
 * remove last group from skip select list - cannot skip the last one.  Need to handle when changed.
 * use Helmet to change the title of the page
 + use table partitioning for managing requests and forms (see: https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/12.2/vldbg/partition-create-tables-indexes.html)
 * when reviewing (i.e. approver) hide tabs other than review and comments?
 + add default routing in settings
 * user should show dept and associated group
 + switch delete modals to component: ModalConfirm
 + "globalize" icons (e.g. the "save" icon should be the same for all; this may be making buttons a component)
 * On app error allow "reset"; test with undefined import component.

Future enhancement:
 * add ability to selectively search columns on the hierarchy. (e.g. only show specific PosType), Only show specific WFIDs)
