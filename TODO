bug/fix:
 * impersonation transitions are clunky; need to re-work somehow.
 * add "id" key for all tables data

todo: 
 * add setting to enable/disable rejections for requests (not currently used in prod, helpful for testing).
 * when reviewing (i.e. approver) hide tabs other than review and comments?
 * work on comments tab when not draft.
 * split hierarchy/workflow code to lazy load
 * add default routing in settings
 * user should show dept and associated group
 * switch delete modals to component: ModalConfirm
 * build request archive tables: journal and request

Future enhancement:
 * add ability to selectively search columns on the hierarchy. (e.g. only show specific PosType), Only show specific WFIDs)
