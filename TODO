todo: 
 * when reviewing (i.e. approver) hide tabs other than review and comments?
 * split hierarchy/workflow code to lazy load
 * add default routing in settings
 * user should show dept and associated group
 * switch delete modals to component: ModalConfirm

Future enhancement:
 * add ability to selectively search columns on the hierarchy. (e.g. only show specific PosType), Only show specific WFIDs)
